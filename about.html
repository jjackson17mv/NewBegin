    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>My name is Joshua and I am a full time Full Stack Engineer and soccer enthusiast. I am from Martha's Vineyard, MA and moved to San Diego in 2016. I moved to San Diego for the beautiful weather, beaches, and year round soccer capabilities.Outside of playing sports, My hobbies include spending time with family, learning about the forever changing technological advancements. Music is a big passion of mine, but limited to playing the violin and the now deprecated Guitar Hero.</p>
    <p>I have always had an interest in computers, my first Desktop was a Gateway 2000. My appreciation for technology has come from living through the advancements or the "stone age" of dial-up to fast speed cable modems and to now wifi.Quake 2 was the first game I played and figured out how to download and unzip different avatars and that was when I realized that im obssessed with computer processing power.</p>
    The question of "Whats next?" does not just belong to Apple products, I ask that question after every completed assignment or project that fuels the flames of passion to learn and educate myself everyday</p>
